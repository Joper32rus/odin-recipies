    <p>
        Borscht is a sour soup that is traditionally made with meat stock and boiled vegetables.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The Ukrainian version, which features beets, is perhaps the most well known type — but varieties of borscht can be found throughout Central and Eastern Europe and Northern Asia.
